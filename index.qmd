title: "The Triathlon Python Package"
---

Triathlon results are packed with information about performance, but the raw data is often inconsistent and hard to analyze. This project is a Python package that collects, cleans, and analyzes triathlon split times to produce clear metrics and visuals across swim, bike, and run, with an accompanying Streamlit app for interactive exploration.
